# Pragma
 Pragma

Pragma is a 40% keyboard designed to use a perimeter oring style mount which, depending on the plate, provides a slight bounce and was designed with overall consistency in mind.

It features an accentuated front lip for comfortable typing, a 5 degree angle, and small assembly posts for simple and secure assembly.

This design has been tested through two revisions of aluminum case parts and brass and stainless steel weights.

This case and plate were specifically designed around the Omnibus PCB. Other minivan pcbs may work, but have not been tested. Use at your own risk.

Below is a list of parts you may need:


Bottom-Top screws:
4x sockethead m2.5 10mm

Daughterboard screws:
2x button/rounded head m2 3mm

O-ring:
AS568-262 or similar should fit. There is room for larger orings, you can kinda cram them in. Experiment and have fun.
